01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

# My Task

In this assignment we were presented an image of a webpage, a index.html file, and a style.css file. 
The goal of this assignment was for us to refractor the code, which is the process of restructing exsisting computer code without actaully changing any of the external behavior. 

# The Work

1. In this assignment there was a large amount of unecessary CSS code that was either a duplicate, didn't link to anything, or just messy. 
I took out the unnecessary code in the CSS, grouped together different styles in the CSS that took up space and didn't need to be seperated, and made sure to put comments on the reamining CSS to ensure that it had a purpose in the exsisting code. 

2. In the html file the images were missing "alt" tags, so I added those in the appropriate places.

3. Lastly, there were a fex issues with the code; the link to a search button did not work, certain images were out of place, and there were minor issues with text. I corrected all the flaws with the current text without altering the actual behavior of the webpage making it functional and formatted. I also successfully made my webpage match the image to my best ability.
